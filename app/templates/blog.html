                    <p>Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. The main components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing.
                        The practice originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in other countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now commonplace in leisure centres, health clubs, schools, hospitals and surgeries.

                      <p id="p1"> The benefits of Yoga:</p>
                      <p> Dozens of scientific trials of varying quality have been published on yoga.
                        While there's scope for more rigorous studies on its health benefits, most studies suggest yoga is a safe and effective way to increase physical activity, especially strength, flexibility and balance.
                        There's some evidence that regular yoga practice is beneficial for people with high blood pressure, heart disease, aches and pains – including lower back pain – depression and stress.</p>
                        <p id="p1"> What style of yoga should I do?</p>
                        <p> There are many different styles of yoga, such as Ashtanga, Iyengar and Sivananda. Some styles are more vigorous than others, while some may have a different area of emphasis, such as posture or breathing. Many yoga teachers develop their own practice by studying more than one style.
                          No style is necessarily better or more authentic than any other. The key is to choose a class appropriate for your fitness level.</p>
                          <p id="p1"> Types of Yoga:</p>
                          <p>  You have many types of yoga to choose from. They use different kinds of movements called poses. You may prefer a certain type, depending on your goals and fitness level: <br>

                            <b> Hatha yoga</b> - This form of yoga is the most popular in the U.S. It’s known as the yoga of force. It emphasizes strengthening and purifying the body. It involves physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama).
                            <br>
                            <b>Iyengar yoga</b>- This style of yoga focuses on alignment. It is fluid and dancelike. It uses props like wooden blocks, straps, chairs, bolsters, and blankets to help you achieve and hold postures you otherwise couldn't hold.
                            <br>
                            <b>Ashtanga yoga</b>- This kind of yoga is sometimes called ashtanga vinyasa or power yoga. It's intense and fast-paced. It’s designed to build your endurance and strength. You do a series of postures in 1 continuous, flowing movement. You link the motions to breathing patterns.
                            <br>
                            <b>Bikram yoga</b>- You do this form of yoga in a very hot room, unlike many other types of yoga. Bikram yoga involves a set of 26 postures that you practice twice per session. First you do standing and balance poses. Then you do back bends, forward bends, and twisting postures.
                            <br>
                            <b>Restorative yoga</b>- This type of yoga does not use active postures. It focuses instead on the relaxation part of yoga.
                            <br>
                            <b>Kripalu yoga</b>- This is a gentler, slower-moving style of yoga. It’s between restorative yoga and the more vigorous forms.</p>

                            The English writer Katie Oldham described the “surreal” act of reading a book this way:
                           “You stare at marked slices of tree for hours on end, hallucinating vividly.” </p>
