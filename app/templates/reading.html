                    <p> As you read these words, your brain is decoding a series of abstract symbols and synthesizing the results into complex ideas.
                        It’s an amazing process. The English writer Katie Oldham described the “surreal” act of reading a book this way: 
                        “You stare at marked slices of tree for hours on end, hallucinating vividly.”
                        And as if it weren’t already strange enough, consider this: If you do enough of it that is, read a lot it may not only rewire parts of your brain,
                        but perhaps even make you a nicer person. (Maybe. More on that below.)
                        While the brain remains a massive and often murky frontier for scientific research, we’re devoted fans of the written word and we’re 
                        always keen to learn more about the neurological effects of one of our favorite pastimes.
                        Human beings invented reading only a few thousand years ago. And with this invention, we rearranged the very organization of our brain, 
                        which in turn expanded the ways we were able to think,
                        which altered the intellectual evolution of our species.
                        Our ancestors’ invention could come about only because of the human brain’s extraordinary ability to make new connections among its existing structures, 
                        a process made possible by the brain’s ability to be reshaped by experience.

                      <p id="p1"> Why children and parents should read together</p>
                      <p> Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic recommend that parents read with their children beginning as early as infancy and continuing through elementary school years.
                          Reading with your children builds warm and happy associations with books, increasing the likelihood that kids will find reading enjoyable in the future.
                          Reading at home boosts school performance later on. It also increases vocabulary, raises self-esteem, builds good communication skills, and strengthens 
                          the prediction engine that is the human brain.</p>
                      <p id="p1"> Builds your vocabulary</p>
                      <p> Reading researchers as far back as the 1960s have discussed what’s known as “the Matthew effectTrusted Source,” 
                        a term that refers to biblical verse Matthew 13:12: “Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
                        The Matthew effect sums up the idea that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer — a concept that applies as much to vocabulary as it does to money.
                        Researchers have foundTrusted Source that students who read books regularly, beginning at a young age, gradually develop large vocabularies. 
                        And vocabulary size can influence many areas of your life, from scores on standardized tests to college admissions and job opportunities.</p>
                      <p id="p1"> What should you be reading?</p>
                      <p> 
                        So, what should you be reading? The short answer is: Whatever you can get your hands on.
                        There was a time when remote regions had to rely on librarians traversing the mountains with books stuffed in saddlebags. 
                        But that’s hardly the case today. Just about everyone can access vast libraries contained in cellphones and tablets.
                        If you’re pressed for time, devote a few minutes daily to a blog on a niche topic. If you’re looking for an escape, 
                        fantasy or historical fiction can transport you out of your own surroundings and into another world altogether.
                        If you’re on a career fast-track, read nonfiction advice offered by someone who’s already arrived. Consider it a mentorship 
                        you can pick up and put down when it suits your schedule.
                        One thing to note: Don’t read solely on a device. Flip through print books, too
                        Reading is very, very good for you. It’s especially important for children to read as much as possible because the effects of reading are cumulative. 
                        However, it’s never too late to begin taking advantage of the many physical and psychological benefits waiting for you in the pages of a good book.
